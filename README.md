This repository demonstrates the application of transfer learning for multiclass classification using the ResNet50 architecture. By leveraging the pre-trained knowledge of ResNet, I fine-tune the final layers of the model to adapt to the sign language digit dataset, enabling efficient classification of hand signs ranging from 0 to 9.
